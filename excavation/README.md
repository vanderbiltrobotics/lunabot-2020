# Digging Code

Package for controlling the excavator.

The Pose2D message for the arm should be in meters and radians, and the origin is the base of the arm. X points towards the center of the robot, y points towards the sky, and theta measures the angle between the bucket and the y axis. 


Launches the excavation node along with rviz for visualization

```
roslaunch excavation rviz_dig.launch
```
