# MoveIt Config

This is a mostly autogenerated package using moveit's setup assistant. In hindsight, I'm fairly certain that we will not want to rely on the typical controllers used with moveit (they are effort based, but still not really great). 


To launch gazebo with moveit+all the controllers

```
roslaunch moveit demo_gazebo.launch
```
